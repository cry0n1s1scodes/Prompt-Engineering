## Role:
Act as an expert **[Specify Programming Language, e.g., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Go]** developer and code optimization specialist. You are highly proficient in writing clean, efficient, secure, and maintainable code, strictly adhering to best practices for **[Specify Language/Framework, e.g., Python with Django, React.js, Spring Boot, Gin Gonic]**.

## Primary Task:
Your objective is to generate **[Specify type of code, e.g., a function, a class, a script, a module, an API endpoint, a complete algorithm implementation]** that performs the following core task: **[Describe the core functionality in clear, unambiguous detail. What is the primary goal of this code?]**

## Context & Environment:
*   **Programming Language & Version:** [e.g., Python 3.10+, Node.js 20.x, Java 17, Go 1.20]
*   **Framework/Libraries (if any):** [e.g., React 18.2, Django 4.2, Spring Boot 3.1, NumPy 1.25, Express.js 4.18. Specify versions if critical.]
*   **Operating System (if relevant):** [e.g., OS-agnostic, Linux (Ubuntu 22.04), Windows 11, macOS Ventura]
*   **Execution Environment (if relevant):** [e.g., Web Browser (Chrome latest), Server-side Node.js, Docker container, AWS Lambda, Embedded system with X constraints]
*   **Integration Points (if applicable):** [Describe how this code will integrate with existing systems. e.g., "This function will be called by an existing FastAPI endpoint," "This class must implement the `XYZInterface` from `library.abc`," "Input data comes from a Kafka topic named 'input_data'." Provide relevant existing function signatures or class structures if necessary.]

## Detailed Functional Requirements:
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Describe all expected inputs precisely.
    *   Specify data types (e.g., integer, string, list of objects, custom class `UserInput`).
    *   Define formats and structures (e.g., "Input is a JSON string with schema: `{ 'id': int, 'name': string }`", "Input is a file path to a CSV").
    *   List any constraints on inputs (e.g., "User ID must be a positive integer", "String length < 255 characters", "List must not be empty").
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Describe the expected outputs precisely.
    *   Specify data types and formats (e.g., "Returns a boolean", "Outputs a JSON object with schema: `{ 'status': 'success'|'error', 'data': ... }`", "Writes results to a file named 'output.txt'").
    *   Detail success and failure states/outputs.
*   **Core Logic & Algorithm:**
    *   Provide a step-by-step description of the algorithm or logic the code should implement.
    *   If complex, break it down into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Mention any specific mathematical formulas, business rules, or state transitions.
*   **Edge Cases & Boundary Conditions:**
    *   List specific edge cases that must be handled robustly (e.g., empty inputs, null values, invalid data formats, zero division, file not found, network timeouts, maximum load).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Specify how errors should be detected and handled (e.g., "Raise specific custom exceptions like `InvalidInputError` or `ProcessingError`," "Return specific error codes/JSON responses," "Log errors to stderr with a specific format," "Implement retries for transient errors").

## Optimization Goals & Non-Functional Requirements (Prioritize if conflicting):
1.  **Correctness & Reliability:** The code must produce accurate results according to the functional requirements and handle all specified edge cases gracefully.
2.  **Performance:** [Specify performance targets, e.g., "Optimize for low latency response time (< X ms under Y load)", "Minimize memory footprint to < Z MB", "Achieve a throughput of N requests/second", "Efficiently process large datasets (up to P GB/TB or Q million records)"].
3.  **Security:** [Specify security considerations, e.g., "Sanitize all external inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection)", "Use parameterized queries/prepared statements", "Avoid hardcoding secrets", "Implement proper authentication/authorization checks if applicable", "Adhere to OWASP Top 10 principles"].
4.  **Readability & Maintainability:**
    *   Code must be well-commented, especially for complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
    *   Follow idiomatic coding conventions for **[Specify Language]** (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Java Style Guide). Use clear and descriptive variable/function/class names.
    *   Structure the code logically (e.g., small functions with single responsibilities, clear separation of concerns).
5.  **Efficiency:** Implement algorithms and data structures that are efficient in terms of time and space complexity for the expected scale of input.
6.  **Modularity & Reusability:** Design components (functions, classes) to be modular and potentially reusable, with well-defined interfaces.
7.  **Testability:** Code should be structured to be easily unit-testable. [Optional: "Generate accompanying unit tests using [testing framework, e.g., pytest, JUnit, Jest] that cover primary functionality, key edge cases, and error conditions."]
8.  **Dependencies:** [e.g., "Minimize external dependencies", "Only use libraries from an approved list: [X, Y, Z]", "Ensure compatibility with library P version Q"].

## Negative Constraints (What to Avoid):
*   Avoid using [Specify any deprecated libraries, anti-patterns, specific functions, or outdated language features to avoid].
*   Do not include [Specify features or behaviors that are explicitly NOT desired].
*   Avoid solutions that are overly complex if a simpler, equally effective one exists.
*   Do not rely on undocumented features or behavior of external libraries/systems.

## Output Format & Deliverables:
*   **Primary Output:** Provide the complete, runnable, and optimized code within a single markdown code block, correctly formatted for **[Specify Language]**.
*   **File Structure (if applicable):** If the solution involves multiple files or a specific directory structure, please describe it clearly before the code block(s).
*   **Comments:** Include concise, meaningful comments within the code to explain:
    *   The purpose of major code blocks, functions, and classes.
    *   Complex or non-obvious logic.
    *   Assumptions made.
    *   Important pre-conditions or post-conditions.
*   **Explanatory Notes (Optional but Recommended):** After the code block, provide a brief section explaining:
    *   Key design choices and architectural decisions, especially regarding trade-offs made for optimization (e.g., "Chose algorithm X over Y for better average-case time complexity despite higher memory usage because...").
    *   Any assumptions made if the requirements were perceived as ambiguous.
    *   Brief instructions for compilation, execution, or integration, if not obvious.
    *   Potential areas for future improvement or further optimization, if any.

## Clarification Protocol:
If any part of this request is unclear, ambiguous, or seems contradictory, please ask clarifying questions *before* generating the code. It is crucial to have a full understanding to produce an optimal solution.

## Call to Action:
Please generate the optimal code based on the detailed specifications provided above.
