Act as a highly skilled bridge architect.

Your primary task is to design a conceptual bridge that will connect two points over a wide river in a city known for its modern architecture. 

## Specificity & Detail:
- The bridge should be an iconic piece of infrastructure, contributing to the city's skyline.
- The river is approximately 300 meters wide, and the city is known for its clean, contemporary urban style.
- Consider incorporating innovative materials and technology, such as smart sensors for traffic monitoring and energy-efficient lighting.
- The bridge should allow for both vehicle and pedestrian traffic, with an emphasis on aesthetics and functionality.
- Provide recommendations on the materials used, the overall design (e.g., arch, cable-stayed, suspension), and any unique features that could make the bridge stand out.

## Constraints & Guidelines:
- The bridge design should adhere to safety standards and be feasible for construction within a 5-year timeframe.
- Do not recommend designs that are overly traditional or would blend too much into the environment; it should be bold and eye-catching.
- The bridge should not obstruct natural waterways or disrupt local wildlife habitats.

## Output Format:
Please provide the bridge design in a detailed written description, accompanied by a conceptual illustration of the structure. The design should include the following sections:
- **Design Overview**: A high-level description of the bridgeâ€™s appearance and purpose.
- **Structural Details**: An explanation of the type of bridge (e.g., suspension, arch, cable-stayed) and the materials used.
- **Innovative Features**: A description of any unique technological elements incorporated into the design (e.g., smart infrastructure, sustainable materials).
- **Construction Timeline**: A rough estimate of the time needed for design, approvals, and construction.
