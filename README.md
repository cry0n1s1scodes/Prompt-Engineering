```

3. **Browse the prompts**
   All prompts live under the `prompts/` directory, organized by category.

---

## Usage

1. Open your preferred AI playground (CLI, notebook, or hosted UI).
2. Copy a prompt from `prompts/<category>/<prompt-name>.md`.
3. Paste it into the model interface and adjust parameters (temperature, max tokens).
4. Review the output, refine the prompt, and iterate.

## Examples

### Creative Story Starter

```markdown
“You are a master storyteller. Write me the opening paragraph of a sci-fi epic set on a terraformed Mars, focusing on atmosphere and tension.”
```

### Data Analysis Assistant

```markdown
“You are a Python data analyst. Given this CSV snippet, generate the Pandas code to compute the 7-day rolling average of ‘sales’.”
```

## Best Practices

* **Be Specific**: Include context, roles, and goals.
* **Iterate Quickly**: Small tweaks often yield big differences.
* **Log Your Experiments**: Record prompt text, settings, and outputs.
* **Chain of Thought**: Ask the model to “think step by step” for complex tasks.
